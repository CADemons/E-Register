# Pug

What is pug? Well, pug is the new name for "jade" which is a programming language designed to translate a markdown style code to html. It works almost seamlessly with express.js, and in some sense could be preferred. 

If you've navigated here, I presume that you have wondered what Pug is, and why there is a folder here. You, who is editing the web page style, should know that there is a choice. You can either write your html files in Pug, or write them in plain html. There is little difference.

Please notify me which one you choose. Thanks,
