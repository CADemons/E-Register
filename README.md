# E-Register
Our electronic registration page for Club Expo 

Probably to be written using Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JQuery. 

To contribute, I suggest either cloning and working on it (although it's linked to my Heroku app) or forking and making pull requests (I suggest the latter).

## Getting Started

First clone the repository via `git clone
https://github.com/CADemons/E-Register.git` 

Then navigate to the E-Register Folder, and do `npm install` 

After modifying index.html / adding files, to run the app, `node lib/index.js` 

The local page will be running at `localhost:3000`
